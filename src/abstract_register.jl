data type.

"""
    nactive(register) -> Int

Returns the number of active qubits.

note!!!

    Operatiors always apply on active qubits.
"""

"""
    nqubits(register) -> Int

Returns the (total) number of qubits. See [`nactive`](@ref), [`nremain`](@ref)
for more details.
"""

"""
    nremain(register) -> Int

Returns the number of non-active qubits.
"""

"""
    nbatch(register) -> Int

Returns the number of batches.
"""

"""
    datatype(register) -> Int

Returns the numerical data type used by register.

note!!!

    `datatype` is not the same with `eltype`, since `AbstractRegister` family
    is not exactly the same with `AbstractArray`, it is an iterator of several
    registers.
"""

"""
    viewbatch(register, i::Int) -> AbstractRegister{1}

Returns a view of the i-th slice on batch dimension.
"""

"""
    state(register) -> AbstractMatrix

Returns the raw state of register. This always returns a matrix which is a batch
of quantum states.
"""

"""
    addbit!(register, n::Int) -> register
    addbit!(n::Int) -> Function

addbit the register by n bits in state |0>.

If only an integer is provided, then perform lazy evaluation.
"""

"""
    join(::AbstractRegister...) -> register

Merge several registers as one register via tensor product.
"""

Repeat register `r` for `n` times on batch dimension.

### Example

Returns an `UnitRange` of the all the bits in the Hilbert space of given register.
